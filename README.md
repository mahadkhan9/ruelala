# Ruelala demand prediction
Predicted demand for Rue La La fashion store's first exposure styles (styles newly offered by the store) and their optimal price using methods such as k-means clustering, decision tree analysis, and Rue La La. Data was obtained from the HBS case study.
There were two main decision factors here 
1. Lower price and significantly increased demand
2. Raise price without significantly affecting
demand

To solve this business problem, I had to calculate the true demand for older items first using K means clustering and later predict the demand for first exposure styles.
This was used to predict the optimal pricing for the products to maximize revenue using decision trees and regression analysis.

In conclusion, the optimal values found were 
$30 for item 1 
$35 for item 2 
$30 for item 3

This brought the total revenue to $522604, which was the maximum.
